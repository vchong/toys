This is a random-ish collection of tools and toys.

Generally speaking they are too small to live in their own repo but are
too useful to risk mislaying.

 * bin/ contains convenience commands, mostly related to kernel development
 * jenkins/ contains some utilities to help run backups using jenkins
 * loop/ is a utility to forcibly allocate loop device nodes (allowing them
   to be shared with containers)
 * tests/ contains a couple of ad-hoc test suites

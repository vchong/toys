loop-alloc
==========

Boot service that allocates loop devices regardless of the value of
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT. Forcing loop devices to exist allows
them to be passed as block devices into virtual machines or containers.

For example to enable loop device support for libvirt's LXC driver the
following is added to the domain XML but libvirt will error out if
the devices do not already exist:

    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='misc'>
      <source>
        <char>/dev/loop-control</char>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop0</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop1</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop2</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop3</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop4</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop5</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop6</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>
    <hostdev mode='capabilities' type='storage'>
      <source>
        <block>/dev/loop7</block>
      </source>
    </hostdev>

loop-alloc.service is a systemd unit that ensures the loop devices are
allocated before libvirtd starts up (making it possible for machine like
the above to be autostarted.

    sudo cp loop-alloc.service /etc/systemd/system
    sudo systemctl enable loop-alloc
